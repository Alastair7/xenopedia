# What is Xenopedia?
Xenopedia it's just a simple app made for just one purpose: Save that long and funny messages you've seen on the Internet or you made.

## My First APP
This APP is made just for my friends, so I'm not interested in working even more on it. I did it because I wanted to try Kotlin, Room, Kotlin coroutines...
So, the language is Spanish.

## What I've used to create it:
  - Android Studio.
  - Kotlin as programming language.
  - Git.

## What can I do in the APP?
  - Add/Edit/Delete text.
  - Save it to clipboard to use it wherever you want.
